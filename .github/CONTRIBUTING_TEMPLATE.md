## Development Workflow

### Working on Issues

1. **Find an issue** to work on:
   - Look for `good first issue` or `help wanted` labels
   - Comment on the issue to claim it
   - Wait for maintainer approval before starting

2. **Create a branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/bug-description
   ```

3. **Make your changes**:
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Follow the coding standards
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Test your changes thoroughly

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: brief description of changes"
   ```
   
   Use conventional commit messages:
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation changes
   - `refactor:` for code refactoring
   - `test:` for adding tests
   - `chore:` for maintenance tasks

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Use the PR template
   - Link related issues
   - Describe your changes clearly
   - Add screenshots if applicable

### Testing Your Changes

Before submitting, ensure:

1. **Build succeeds**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Application runs**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Test core features**:
   - Browser navigation
   - AI chat functionality
   - LM Studio connection
   - Agent mode (if applicable)
   - File operations

4. **Test on multiple platforms** (if possible):
   - Windows
   - macOS
   - Linux

### Code Review Process

1. Maintainers will review your PR
2. Address any requested changes
3. Once approved, your PR will be merged
4. Your contribution will be in the next release!

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Style

- Use **TypeScript** for type safety
- Enable strict mode in `tsconfig.json`
- Avoid `any` types when possible
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Document complex types

```typescript
// Good
interface BrowserConfig {
  url: string;
  enableAI: boolean;
}

function navigate(config: BrowserConfig): void {
  // implementation
}

// Avoid
function navigate(config: any): any {
  // implementation
}
```

### Code Formatting

- Use **2 spaces** for indentation
- Use **semicolons**
- Use **single quotes** for strings (unless template literals)
- Max line length: **100 characters**
- Add trailing commas in multi-line objects/arrays

### Naming Conventions

- **Variables/Functions**: camelCase (`getUserData`)
- **Classes/Interfaces**: PascalCase (`BrowserWindow`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_RETRIES`)
- **Files**: kebab-case (`user-manager.ts`)

### Comments

- Write clear, concise comments
- Explain **why**, not **what** (code should be self-explanatory)
- Use JSDoc for functions and classes

```typescript
/**
 * Connects to LM Studio API and validates the connection
 * @param endpoint - The API endpoint URL
 * @returns Promise that resolves when connected
 * @throws Error if connection fails after retries
 */
async function connectToLMStudio(endpoint: string): Promise<void> {
  // implementation
}
```

### Error Handling

- Always handle errors gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors for debugging
- Never expose sensitive information in errors

```typescript
try {
  await performOperation();
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Operation failed:', error);
  showUserFriendlyError('Unable to complete operation. Please try again.');
}
```
