## Basic Browsing

### Navigate to a Website
```
1. Click the URL bar at the top
2. Type: wikipedia.org
3. Press Enter
```
The browser automatically adds `https://` if needed.

### Search the Web
```

2. Type: "artificial intelligence history"
3. Press Enter
```
Without a domain, it's treated as a Google search.

```

---

## Agent Mode Examples

### Example 1: Web Research
**Setup**: Enable "Agent Mode" toggle in toolbar

**You**: "Search for the latest news about artificial intelligence"

**AI**: I'll search for that. I suggest this action:
```
[ACTION:search:latest artificial intelligence news]
```

**Dialog appears**: "AI Agent wants to: search"
- Details: "latest artificial intelligence news"
- Click "Approve"

**Result**: Browser navigates to Google search results

### Example 2: Multi-Step Research
**You**: "Find information about Python decorators and summarize it"

**AI Response**:
```
I'll help you with that:
1. First, let me search for Python decorators
   [ACTION:search:Python decorators tutorial]
2. Then I'll summarize the results
```

**Flow**:
1. Confirmation dialog for search → Approve
2. Navigates to results
3. Confirmation for navigation → Approve
4. Visits a page
5. AI automatically summarizes (if you ask again)

### Example 3: Navigate to Specific Site
**You**: "Go to the official Python website"

**AI**: 
```
I'll navigate to Python's official site:
[ACTION:navigate:https://www.python.org]
```

**Dialog**: Shows URL → Approve → Browser navigates

## Script Automation

### Example 1: Fill a Form Field
**Scenario**: You're on a form with a name input

**You** (in chat): "Can you help me fill the name field with 'John Doe'?"

**AI**: "I can generate a script to fill that field. Here's what I suggest:"
```javascript
document.querySelector('input[name="name"]').value = 'John Doe';
```

**Manual Execution**:
1. Copy the script
2. Go to Tools tab (🛠️)
3. Paste into "Execute Script on Page"
4. Approve the execution dialog

### Example 2: Extract Data from Page
**Script generated by AI**:
```javascript
Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('h2')).map(h => h.textContent);
```

**What it does**: Extracts all H2 headings into an array

**Result**: 
```
["Introduction", "Features", "Installation", "Usage"]
```

### Example 3: Click a Button
**AI suggests**:
```javascript
document.querySelector('#submit-button').click();
```

**Safety**: You see the script before approval, ensuring no unwanted actions.

### Example 4: Highlight Search Results
**You**: "Can you highlight all search results in yellow?"

**AI**:
```javascript
document.querySelectorAll('.search-result').forEach(el => {
  el.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';
});
```

**Note**: Always review scripts before approving!

## File Operations

### Read a File
**Use Case**: You want AI to analyze a text file

**Steps**:
1. Go to Tools tab (🛠️)
2. Click "📂 Read File"
3. Select a file (e.g., `notes.txt`)
4. File content appears in output area
5. Chat with AI about the content

**Example**:
```
You: "I just loaded my meeting notes. Can you create a summary?"
AI: "Based on the file content, here's a summary: ..."
```

### Write a File
**Use Case**: Save AI-generated content

**Steps**:
1. Ask AI to generate content:
   ```
   You: "Write a Python script that prints 'Hello World'"
   ```
2. AI responds with code
3. Go to Tools tab
4. Click "💾 Write File"
5. Paste the AI's code
6. Save dialog appears
7. Choose location and filename

**Alternative**: Ask AI directly:
```
You: "Write a Python hello world script and save it as hello.py"
```
(In Agent Mode, AI can suggest the write operation)

## Advanced Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Research Assistant
**Goal**: Research a topic across multiple sources

**Workflow**:
1. Enable Agent Mode
2. "Research quantum computing and provide a summary from 3 different sources"
3. AI suggests searches and navigation
4. Approve each step
5. AI compiles information from visited pages

### Use Case 2: Code Documentation Helper
**Goal**: Understand code from GitHub

**Workflow**:
1. Navigate to GitHub repository
2. Open a code file
3. Select a function
4. Enable "Use selected text"
5. Ask: "Explain what this function does and how it works"

### Use Case 3: Form Automation
**Goal**: Speed up repetitive form filling

**Workflow**:
1. Navigate to form
2. Ask AI: "Generate a script to fill this form with test data"
3. AI creates script with placeholders
4. Review and customize values
5. Execute via Tools tab

**Example AI Script**:
```javascript
document.querySelector('#firstName').value = 'John';
document.querySelector('#lastName').value = 'Doe';
document.querySelector('#email').value = 'john@example.com';
document.querySelector('#phone').value = '555-0100';
```

### Use Case 4: Content Extraction
**Goal**: Extract structured data from websites

**Workflow**:
1. Navigate to a page with data (e.g., product listings)
2. Ask: "Extract all product names and prices from this page"
3. AI generates extraction script
4. Execute and copy results
5. Optionally: "Save this as a CSV file"

**Example Script**:
```javascript
const products = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.product')).map(p => ({
  name: p.querySelector('.name').textContent,
  price: p.querySelector('.price').textContent
}));
JSON.stringify(products, null, 2);
```

### Use Case 5: Learning Assistant
**Goal**: Learn while browsing

**Workflow**:
1. Navigate to educational content
2. Keep "Use page context" enabled
3. Ask questions about the material:
   - "What are the key concepts on this page?"
   - "Can you give me an example of [concept]?"
   - "How does this relate to [other topic]?"

### Use Case 6: Website Testing
**Goal**: Test form validations or UI interactions

**Workflow**:
1. Navigate to your website (localhost or production)
2. Ask AI: "Test the email validation by entering invalid emails"
3. AI generates test script
4. Review and execute
5. Observe results

**Example**:
```javascript
const emailInput = document.querySelector('#email');
const testEmails = ['invalid', 'test@', '@test.com', 'valid@test.com'];

testEmails.forEach(email => {
  emailInput.value = email;
  emailInput.dispatchEvent(new Event('input'));
  console.log(`${email}: Valid = ${emailInput.checkValidity()}`);
});
```
